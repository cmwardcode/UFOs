# JavaScript Webpage Analysis - UFO Sightings
## Overview of Project
Building a dynamic webpage through JavaScript. To modify the design to create the desired functionality and aesthetics with Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS tools.
### Purpose
Further developing the webpage to incorporate dynamic tables that filters through data for multiple criteria simultaneously. 
## Results

The interactive portion of the webpage is located on the bottom left of the page under the “Filter Search” label. Users can then filter by one or all of the search criteria (date, city, state, country, shape). Once the filter information is input and the “Fitler Table” button is selected the table will be produced to the right of the criteria. The table reflects reported UFO sightings that match the criteria input. 
## Summary
### Drawbacks
The input data is very specific format that is “case-sensitive” and there is no information provided to the user to let them know this information. Another drawback is the data is limited and not from an updated source. 
### Recommendations for further development
Making the search criteria input more user friendly through modifications to remove “case-sensitive” format. The second recommendation would be to incorporate pulling in live data so the user has access to a broader variety of data and it is more recent.
